## Modifying appearance

To change the appearance of the site, you can edit the default styles file and add others from your liking. The file **globals.css** is inside the folder **/src/styles**.

## Sass e SCSS

For the sake of simplicity, Sass support was not added by default. If you prefer, you can add it to Gatsby using [plugins](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/styling/sass/).
